## Notes

While creating the web application I forgot that you could serve html files statically from the server, instead I was trying to make routes on the backend that just send the api data, but then I rememered even though this is what I was used to, I had to statically render this html.
I also had to frequently figure out how to do things in vanilla javascript using web apis and dom manipulation, something I hadn't done in a good while, but not something which I forgot exists, it was tedious and incovenient for someone so spoiled with react and tailwindcss, use pure css and vanilla javascript is something that takes getting used to.
I felt challenged as I had waited until the day the assignment was due, which was a horrible idea, but I was so busy with my car, school work, and just general studying that I somewhat dismissed the fact I had an assignment coming, but really, it's because I thought I had another day ðŸ˜­
In the future I will do my best not to make the same time management mistake and this project has taught me that lesson the hard way, not one of my prettiest projects, that's for sure
Despite these challenges I've managed to completely the project successfully as per requirements, except using picocss, I was not aware that was a necessary requirement, in fact I'm still unaware if it is, I feel the lab would've mentioned it tbh, in any case, I sleep now, thank you CodePath
